# HCL Tech Mini Embedded Project
This is my Mini Project on STM32F405 custom board to describe some function of a car

## This file include:
- STM32CubeIDE project.
- Proteus simulation project.
- A Document of the project.

##	Project Requirement
- GPIO as Digital Output (interface with on onboard LEDs).
- GPIOs as Digital Inputs (interface with onboard Switch).
- Debounce logic (interface with onboard Switch)/Interrupts.
- Timers (counts, timed delays).
- PWM Control (frequency & duty cycle variations).
- Analog to Digital Conversion (display fuel level).
- Communication Protocol â€“ UART (status message to live expression window).
